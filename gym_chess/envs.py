`python-chess` package, which implements the underlying game mechanics.

class Chess(gym.Env):
    """Base environment for the game of chess.

    This env does not have a built-in opponent; moves are made for both the 
    black and the white player in turn. At any given timestep, the env expects a 
    legal move for the current player, otherwise an Error is raised. 

    The agent is awarded a reward of +1 if the white player makes a winning move
    and -1 if the black player makes a winning move. All other rewards are zero.
    Since the winning player is always the last one to move, this is the only 
    way to assign meaningful rewards based on the outcome of the game.

    Observations and actions are represented as `Board` and `Move` objects, 
    respectively. The actual encoding as numpy arrays is left to wrapper classes
    for flexibility and separation of concerns (see the `wrappers` module for 
    examples). As a consequence, the `observation_space` and `action_space`
    members are set to `None`.

    Observation:
        Type: chess.Board

        Note: Modifying the returned `Board` instance does not modify the 
        internal state of this env.

    Actions:
        Type: chess.Move

    Reward:
        +1/-1 if white or black makes a winning move, respectively.

    Starting State:
        The usual initial board position for chess, as defined by FIDE

    Episode Termination:
        Either player wins.
        The game ends in a draw (e.g. stalemate, insufficient matieral,
        fifty-move rule, threefold repetition)

        Note: Surrendering is not an option.
