class BoardEncoding(gym.ObservationWrapper):
    """Implements the board encoding from AlphaZero.
    
    This wrapper converts observations (i.e. `chess.Board` instances) from the 
    wrapped `Chess` environment to numpy arrays, using the encoding proposed in 
    [Silver et al., 2017].
    
    An observation is represented as an array of shape (8, 8, k * 14 + 7). This
    can be thought of as a stack of "planes" of size 8 x 8, where each of the 
    k * 14 + 7 planes represents a different aspect of the game.   

    The first k * 14 planes encode the k most recent board positions, here 
    refered to as the board's "history", grouped into sets of 14 planes per
    position. The first six planes in a set of 14 denote the pieces of the 
    active player (i.e. the player for which the agent will move next). Each of 
    the six planes is associated with a particular piece type  (pawn, knight, 
    bishop, queen and king, respectively). The subsequent six planes encode the 
    pieces of the opponent player, following the same scheme. The final two 
    planes are binary (i.e. either all ones or zeros), and indicate two-fold 
    and three-fold repetition of the encoded position over the course of the 
    current game. Note that in each step, all board representations in the 
    history are reoriented to the perspective of the active player.

    The remaining 7 planes encode meta-information about the game state: the 
    color of the active player (0 = Black, 1 = White), the total move count, 
    castling rights for the active player and her opponent (kingside and 
    queenside, respectively), and lastly, the halfmove-clock.

    Args:
        env: The wrapped env.
        history_length: The number of recent board positions encoded in an
            observation (corresponds to the 'k' parameter above).

    Observations:
        Box(8, 8, k * 14 + 7)

        Note: Not all possible instances of this observation space encode legal 
        board positions. It is thus not advised to use 
        env.observation_space.sample() to generate board positions.
